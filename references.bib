               While most research in this area operates on the macro level,
               the author provides individual-level evidence. In doing so, the
               author investigates the assumed causal link with panel data from
               Switzerland and the Netherlands. In addition, the author studies
               the impact on life satisfaction, a ?control outcome,? known to
               be affected by unemployment. Although there is strong evidence
               that changes in employment status do affect life satisfaction,
               effects on trust in government and satisfaction with democracy
               seem mostly absent or negligible in size.",

               Countries",
  author    = "Kirsop, Barbara and Chan, Leslie",
  abstract  = "AbstractThe economic development of a country depends heavily on
               its scientific strength and ability to resolve problems in such
               areas as public health, infectious disease, environmental
               management, or industrial progress. Access to research
               information traditionally depends on ability to pay, which has a
               negative impact on developing countries. A number of new
               initiatives address this imbalance, ranging from consortial
               licensing and new publishing models to the Open Access
               Initiative, and have the ability to meet the needs of research
               in financially constrained countries. The advent of the Open
               Access strategies, particularly interoperable institutional
               archives, has the potential to revolutionize access to essential
               research.",
